long before this kind of things break out all right long before this happens there is a particular mode of behavior they are already in and you know what it is church is legalism the more legalistic you are the more you depend on yourself effort the more and the law you are it is a matter of time your flesh will break out into works of the Flesh and you do something crazy you can see a man these two anyway all right so let's look at the teaching part of it so that tonight we established this and I believe that God has something powerful for us a man Church Romans real quick and Roman saini what are the phrases of walking according to the Flesh and walking according to the spirit in fact in your verse one of chapter 8 in your old King James and your new King James you have this month it's safe there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus having a glad that is present tense there for now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus are you in Christ Jesus there is present tense there for now present tense what no condemnation so that's wonderful chapter of Romans opens up with no condemnation it closes with no separation from God's love amen in between nothing but victory but in Romans seven the Apostle Paul was under what we call the Wilderness experience he was going through things like the good I want to do I do it not the evil I want to do it and I'm doing so when I do the thing I want to do I admonish I want to do good but when I find I want to do good evil is present with me of course none of us experienced that okay but what brought Paul out of the struggle of Romans seven is the very first verse the gateway to the life of the spirit is Romans eight verse one there is therefore now no condemnation off and you must know there is no condemnation venue have the victory you see the woman caught in adultery when she came to when she was thrown right before Jesus the Bible tells us when Jesus defended her he says he doesn't seem sure the first one everybody left one by one now what did Jesus tell her woman where adults who accused you she looked up off no one lots for the first he gave her the the Assurance there was no accusation anymore and who is the number one accuser of the brethren Satan Satan then the Lord said to her what neither do I condemn you now what's thing that you come in what scene was she commenting when she was caught talk to me people more mature adult rate is adultery bad of course amen it's in what did Jesus give her no condemnation then he said to her neither do I condemn you go and sin no more unless she gives people the Assurance there's no condemnation they can never break free from the sin Jesus was gave her Romans 8:1 then he said go and sin No More by many of us we want to we say this you go and sin no more fuss and then I won't condemn you let me see fast right that's human this is divine God give you the gift of no condemnation yes right now you're in the midst of that sin but I give you no condemnation as a gift If you're receiving this gift you are go and sin no more grace does not Empower you to send Grace empowers you to live for God from the depths of your heart. Have a good day man all right so look at this in Romans 8:1git on the best translations don't quote the last part where it says who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit all right in fact the whole thing with the you know the whole idea that clashes with the idea that we are in Christ because it depend on the fact there's no condemnation does it depend on the fact that we are in Christ or it depends on our walk the answer is the fact that faith in Christ in fact later on Roman citizens who is he that condemns is Christ that died once you are in Christ there is no condemnation why as if it does not have gone soft know because God condemned Jesus Christ for our sins that's the reason why God can give you a night and don't no condemnation because our students have been with them and God is so faithful and just to his son and what his son has done that got remembered when God condemn his son in our place now God has to suck Us in his place can I have a good amen so once you understand that all right if you ask a question I possibly understand righteousness how can I be righteous having done nothing right the same way Jesus Christ became sick or having done
