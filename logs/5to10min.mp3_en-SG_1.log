 and you know what it is church is legalism
 the more legalistic you are the more you depend on yourself after the mall and the lawyer it is a matter of time your flesh will break out into work for the Flesh and you do something crazy
 you can say Amen it's true anyway
 teaching part of it so that tonight we establish this and I believe that God has something powerful for us Romans 8 real quick and Romans 8 of walking according to the Flesh and walk in Congress. In fact verse 1 of chapter 8 in your old King James and your new King James you have this
 it says there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus I'm glad that is present and therefore now
 no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus are you in Christ Jesus that is present tense therefore now no condemnation wonderful chapter of Romans opens up with no condemnation it closes with no separation from God bless in between nothing but victory
 but in Romans 7 the Apostle Paul Wall and I want to call and see what's going through things like the good I want to do a do it and all the evil I'm going to do it and I'm doing so when I do the going to do I want to do good but when I find out who do good evil is present with me
 Brockport out of the struggle of Roman 7 in the very first verse the gateway to the life of the spirit is Romans 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation and you must know there's no condemnation in adultery when she came through when she was right before Jesus
 the Bible tells us
 when Jesus defended her he says he doesn't lock screen show the first one everybody left one by one woman where are those who accuse you know unlocked for the first game for the the assurance that was no accusation anymore and who is the number one
 Satan Satan
 neither do I condemn you
 talk to me in adultery
 hey man it's been a Jesus deeper no condemnation then he said to work neither do I condemn you go and sin no more unless we give people the assurance that no condemnation they can never break free from the SIM
 Jesus with Capo Romans 8:1
 is it going send no more many of us we wanted to say this you go and sin no more
 and then I won't condemn you let me see first
 write best human David Devine
 but give it a gif of no condemnation yes right now but I give you no condemnation as a gift if you receive this gift you will go and sin no more
 Grace does not Empower you to send great empowers you to live for God from the death of your heart
 can I go to a man all right so look at this in Romans 8:1 saw the best translations don't quote the last part where it says who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit inside the hole in the fact there's no condemnation in Christ died once you're in Christ there is no condemnation the price for our since that's the reason why God can give you a night and don't no condemnation because I was thinking and God is so faithful and just to his son and what his plan has done that got remembered when God condemn his son and I will place but now God has Us in his place
 can I go to a man the ones you understand that all right if you understand righteousness how can I be righteous having done nothing right the same way Jesus Christ became sin heading
