 line upon line verse by verse but you must see for yourself that is not just something
 remember that judge that because something is fresh something is new doesn't mean it's wrong
 hey man you know we are very very comfortable with the familiar on how to hear something new please don't call it heresy don't you know something that something from hell don't do that lets you blaspheme things you don't even know of the very first thing to do is always turn back to this book
 can I go to a man in the gift of the holy spirit because we believe in the charismatic
 the Tennessee's that everybody sing you know we subscribe to the same
 ideas about southern phrases in Walking the spirit is one of them today in the church walking in the spirit man man he's in the floor
 how do you feel that
 see the Goosebumps on my Goosebumps
 the spirit is here
 and that's the whole idea is writing a bit to prove a point
 is it true that people say things like
 strip. He's here in here
 is he still here yes I understand that is a teaching and often experienced anointing upon being led by the spirit but when Paul talks about the flesh are being the spirit he's talking about being born again not being born again
 anime talk about walking in the spirit he's talking about walking in Grace
 what does a walking the flash song about walking in self effort a walking under the law is best way to study days straight when anyone questions you you are able to give Bible chapter and verse all right so tonight we'll make this study and I guarantee you if you listen to buy hearing had Godzilla statue free questions as to why the people you know they can understand great Acts chapter 4 the Bible says with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all power and great grace the next bus says none of them liked that was a time in the early Church in the book of Acts where everybody was killed
 and no one liked and Appraisal Pierce great power and great grace was upon them all and my heart desire is to see a New Creation Church become a place a scent of great grace
 and for that you have not just temperature upgrade going to have great preaching of Grace because the Bible says only the brace and the gift of righteousness we reign in life Romans 9:17 everything there is to know about Grace trust me just when you think you've got it a few weeks back in self effort there is a Warfare launched against people who have the essence of grace and the devil wants to dislodge it from you as soon as you can because you know the longer Gray Station your heart is going to produce
 call the question you always find is a question since you push press what is going to happen if somebody in your congregation is living in sin
 and you go to him and he says to you al pastor I'm under grace
 you know I'll say I said that you are not under grace for sin shall not have dominion over you because you are not under the law but under grace when you are not under law but you under grace single Have No Dominion over you not even talk the talk but it seems to have dominion over you great is only in your head
 a man so I don't want no problem answering the question someone Come Away From Grace the grace of God
 the grace of God will destroy stealing people's lives and that's why you must understand that long before someone phone to send long before this adultery in the person's life long before he dumped his wife for another younger version
