all right into the Bible Romans chapter 8 line upon line verse by verse but you must see for yourself that is not just something remember that judge that because something is fresh something is new doesn't mean it's wrong hey man you know we are very very comfortable with the familiar on how to hear something new please don't call it heresy don't call it you know something that something from hell don't do that less you blaspheme things you don't even know of the very first thing to do is always turn back to this book can i have a good amen once again because we are charismatics, because we pray in tongues, because we move  in the gift of the holy spirit because we believe in the charismatas the tendency is that everybody thinks you know we subscribe to the same ideas about southern phrases in Walking the spirit is one of them today in the church walking in the spirit means man he's in the flow how do you feel that see the Goosebumps on my Goosebumps the spirit is here and that's the whole idea im exagerating a bit to prove a point isnt it true that people sense things like you know the spirit of god is here then what is going to happen when you dont sense him  is he still here yes I understand there is a teaching and also an experience called anointing upon being led by the spirit but when Paul talks about being in the flesh, being the spirit he's talking about being born again or not being born again and then when he talks about walking in the spirit he's talking about walking in Grace what he talks about walking the flesh he is talking about walking in self effort a walking under the law is best we study this so that when anyone questions you you are able to give Bible chapter and verse all right so tonight we'll make this study and I guarantee you if you listen with a hearing heart God is going to set you free he will also answer the questions as to why there are people you know they can understand grace in their heads but they live a lifestyle of sin. Acts chapter 4 the Bible says with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all. notice great power and great grace the next verse says none of them lacked there was a time in the early Church in the book of Acts where everybody was healed and no one lacked and that phrase appears great power and great grace was upon them all and my heart desire is to see New Creation Church become a place a center of great grace and for that you got to have not just some preaching of grace youre got to have great preaching of Grace because the Bible says only through the abbundance of grace and the gift of righteousness we reign in life Romans 5:17 so dont think: "pastor prince i know everything there is to know about Grace trust me just when you think you've got it a few weeks we dont talk about grace you slide back in self effort there is a Warfare launched against people who have sort of grasps the essence of grace and the devil wants to dislodge it from their hearts as soon as he can because he knows the longer grace stays your heart its going to produce so one of   the question you always find is a very typical question well ps prince since you preach grace what is going to happen if somebody in your congregation is living in sin and you go to him and he says to you well pastor I'm under grace you know what I'll say I said that you are not under grace why ? because Romans 6:14 says "for sin shall not have dominion over you because you are not under the law but under grace". when you are not under law but you under grace sin will Have No Dominion over you now you can talk the talk but if sin still has dominion over you grace is only in your head amen so I got no qualm, I got no problem answering that kind of question someone says Comes in no we dont back away From Grace, we exalt the grace of God the grace of God will destroy sin in people's lives and that's why you must understand that long before someone falls into sin ,long before there is adultery in that person's life long before he dumped his wife for another younger version
